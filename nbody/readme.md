Two main files, n2.cpp for the naive algorithm and nlogn.cpp for Barnes-Hut
algorithm. The compile instructions are provided at the bottom line of the
file. For the nlogn one, you may find using cmake be handy. However, it does
not always work if you have multiple compilers.

random\_body.cpp can be used to generate random testing data, the compile
instructions are also provided at the bottom of the file.
