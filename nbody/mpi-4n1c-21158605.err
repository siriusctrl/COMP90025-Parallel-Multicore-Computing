Open MPI tried to fork a new process via the "execve" system call but
failed.  Open MPI checks many things before attempting to launch a
child process, but nothing is perfect. This error may be indicative
of another problem on the target host, or even something as silly as
having specified a directory for your application. Your job will now
abort.

  Local host:        spartan-snowy001
  Working dir:       /home/xinyaon/COMP90025/COMP90025-Parallel-Multicore-Computing/nbody
  Application name:  /home/xinyaon/COMP90025/COMP90025-Parallel-Multicore-Computing/nbody/nlogn
  Error:             No such file or directory

mpirun was unable to start the specified application as it encountered an
error:

Error code: 1
Error name: (null)
Node: spartan-snowy001

when attempting to start process rank 0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun was unable to find the specified executable file, and therefore
did not launch the job.  This error was first reported for process
rank 0; it may have occurred for other processes as well.

NOTE: A common cause for this error is misspelling a mpirun command
      line parameter option (remember that mpirun interprets the first
      unrecognized command line token as the executable).
